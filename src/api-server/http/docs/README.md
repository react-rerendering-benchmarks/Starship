# Docs

Swagger docs are served by HTTP serving handler, and is hosted together with
the HTTP server of which the HTTP APIs are described the Swagger docs.
The spec is embeded in docs code that is generated by
[swag](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-openapi/swag):

```shell
# PWD is the top directory of the Starship repo
swag init -g src/api-server/http/http.go -o src/api-server/http/docs
```

To view API Server's Swagger APIs spec, start API Server with:

```
bazel run src/api-server/cmd:api-server -- \
    --standalone \
    --enable_metadata_service=false \
    --test_only_host=<hostname> \
    --mgmt_ui_port=<port>
```

and then visit the URL:
`http://<hostname>:<port>/swagger/index.html`
